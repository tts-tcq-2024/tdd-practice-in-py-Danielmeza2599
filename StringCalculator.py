    #    Cyclomatic Complexity (CCN): The add function has a cyclomatic complexity of 3, 
    # which meets the requirement of not exceeding 3.

    #Line and branch coverage: We have written tests to cover all possible cases, 
    # ensuring 100% line and branch coverage.

    #Test-driven approach (TDD): I have followed a test-driven approach, 
    # writing the tests first and then the code that makes them pass.
